# binary

Development of this package has continued on `master` and has been published
as a 2.0 - this is mostly kept for backwards compatibility for packages that
rely on binary.

Version 2 has many more performance improvements and you should use that if
you're considering this library.

To specify a version, you can either use something like gopkg:

```
import "gopkg.in/thehowl/binary.v1"
```

Or you can use `dep`, which allows to select the highest released version
of a package (instead of its default branch).

Have fun!
